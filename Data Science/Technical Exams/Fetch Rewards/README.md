## Project Overview
I, like most people, have a difficult time remembering my passwords and refraining from recycling the same 2 passwords out of sheer convience. There are countless methods to store  passwords, ranging from simple pen + paper to using password keychains. This project highlights the process of database develop from start to finish. I started by creating two tables, a master table and a history log and populated them with *random data* (dont even think about stealing my Github password lol). From there I created a package that includes 1 function and 3 procedures. They make use of techniques like triggers, sequences and calling procedures/functions inside another procedure.

## Communicate with Stakeholders
Dear Ms. Smith,
	Thank you for taking the time to meet with me later today. There are a few stoppers that we need to discuss in order for me to continue with my work. After cleaning the data in python, I discovered some quality issues. Could you please provide me with the source of xyz data set, and potentially a contact that I could discuss any technical details with? I need to know a bit more about how this quarter’s data is being structured so that I can reason whether or not some missing values make sense. Lastly, I propose a cross-functional meeting with x department in order to discuss some areas in which we could optimize the data pipeline in order to get it ready for production. I have some concerns about how efficient the process will be if it’s overloaded with data. I’ve cc’d the java team and we can discuss mediation at a later date. See you later today, the meeting should only last around 30 minutes.
  
With Anticipation,

Emily Hersh 


## Conclusion
Thank you for your time and I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can be an asset to your team.
