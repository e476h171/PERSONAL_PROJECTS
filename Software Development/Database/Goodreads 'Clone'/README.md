## Project Overview
I, like most people, have a difficult time remembering my passwords and refraining from recycling the same 2 passwords out of sheer convience. There are countless methods to store  passwords, ranging from simple pen + paper to using password keychains. This project highlights the process of database develop from start to finish. I started by creating two tables, a master table and a history log and populated them with *random data* (dont even think about stealing my Github password lol). From there I created a package that includes 1 function and 3 procedures. They make use of techniques like triggers, sequences and calling procedures/functions inside another procedure.
