# Goodreads Clone
Enclosed in this folder is my project detailing the first steps of database development- demonstrating my ability to write technical documentation and build Entity Relationship Diagrams. 

## Project Overview
Goodreads is a popular website that provides users with information about books and authors, one could say it's the "Spotify" of the literary industry. I personally use this app to find new books and store the ones I want to read in the future. During this project, I worked backwards, first analyzing the website features and then creating an ERD. From there, I wrote the techincal specifications document- detailing a high level overview of the steps needed to create a database structure that would support a website like this.
